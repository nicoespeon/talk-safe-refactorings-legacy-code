## When to use this?

If your IDE can't automate it for you and it's not trivial

3 steps to detect you need that:

1. Start from a clean git status
2. Set a timer to 2 minutes
3. If you can't get the change within 2 mins, use the migration mechanics

You get the mindset. Do more "safe" refactorings. Refactor always, at any time.
